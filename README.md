# Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

In a previous life I helped build early-ish versions of <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/blog/how-credit-karma-makes-real-time-decisions-for-60-million-users-akka-streams-kafka">Credit Karma</a> and managed a few engineering teams, including data/ML, web, and native platforms. 

I'm available to work on new projects. Here's what I've shipped recently:

* Terraform and React to deliver robust front end analytics, streaming data pipelines, and a serverless data warehouse (<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/haven">Haven YC 20</a>)
* Amazon Managed Apache Airflow Terraform configuration, and Python Airflow code (a DAG) that delivered PII filtering, a data transformation platform, and data quality monitoring (<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/haven">Haven YC 20</a>)
* Developed new SDLC process + trained the team (<a href="https://scholarrx.com/">ScholarRx</a>)
