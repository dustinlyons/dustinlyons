# Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

Are you or your team considering a new data initiative, but the team lacks experience in data engineering? Maybe I can help. I have over 10 years experience in data-specific software engineering roles, with 5 years of leadership experience driving analytics engineering strategy at a tech ðŸ¦„.

In a previous life I helped build early-ish versions of <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/blog/how-credit-karma-makes-real-time-decisions-for-60-million-users-akka-streams-kafka">Credit Karma</a> and managed teams across data/ML, web, and native platforms. This included areas like:
* Building ad impression systems
* Managing data quality programs
* Migration to cloud infrastructure, managing data pipeline SLAs
* In-house A/B experimentation systems

Today, I'm hands on and can build across your stack- infrastructure as code, pipelines, API services, or front end with React/Vue. Past clients include (<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/haven">Haven YC 20</a>), (<a href="https://scholarrx.com/">ScholarRx</a>), and the University of Kentucky. Get in touch if you think I can help.
