# Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

I'm currently a Senior Engineering Manager at [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) leading the Client Infrastructure team. We are focused on building the core frameworks that deliver user experiences across client platforms: Swift, Kotlin, Typescript. Previously, I helped build and scale our Analytics Infrastructure, where I was happily devoted to [Scala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7YQDnweQIc), [Akka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbTyy7vWQXo), and Kafka. 

Outside of work I'm into making Linux look nice (see my dotfiles) and learning to develop slackbots.
