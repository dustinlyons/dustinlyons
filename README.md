# Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

In the past, I've worked on:
- Building a novel ad impression system and managing platform teams at [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/)
- Data platforms at [Haven](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/haven)
- A little bit of everything as 3rd engineer at [Zenput](https://www.zenput.com/)

I like talking about:
- State-of-the-art data and analytics engineering (and the scrappy startup stuff)
- Nix and infrastructure-as-code
- Typescript
- Doing cool shit in the Cloud
