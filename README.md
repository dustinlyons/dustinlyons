# Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

In a previous life I helped build early-ish versions of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7YQDnweQIc">Credit Karma</a> and managed a few engineering teams, including data/ML, web, and native platforms. 

Currently, I work as a hands-on consultant focused on data engineering strategy. You can hire me to either consult on strategy + train your team or ship code that

* enables your next data-focused product
* improves how you do analytics
* builds a data lake and enforces data qualty
* implements robust front end web/native tracking

I can write your python or node backend, implement your React or Vue frontend, or create and iterate on your DevOps pipeline. I've spent time to learn it all, so I can help you. Let me help you!

After leaving Credit Karma, I've worked with companies like Haven (YC 19) and the University of Kentucky.
