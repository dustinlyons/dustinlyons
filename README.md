# Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

In a previous life I helped build early-ish versions of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7YQDnweQIc">Credit Karma</a> and managed a few engineering teams, including data/ML, web, and native platforms. 

I'm available to work on new projects. Here's what I've shipped recently:

* Robust front end analytics, AWS pipelines, reporting (<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/haven">Haven YC 20</a>)
* Amazon Managed Apache Airflow terraform configuration, and pipeline code with PII filtering, data transformation, and data quality checks (<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/haven">Haven YC 20</a>)
* Developed new SDLC process + trained the team (<a href="https://scholarrx.com/">ScholarRx</a>)
