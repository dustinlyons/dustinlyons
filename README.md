# Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

Previously I wrote Scala and helped build analytics and client infrastructure with many cool people @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7YQDnweQIc&t=1366s">Credit Karma</a>. Now I spend time consulting and diving into the world of crypto. For fun, I hack on nix, emacs, and my homelab.
