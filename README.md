# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

I'm currently a Senior Engineering Manager at [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) leading the Client Infrastructure team. This means my day to day is spent thinking about our internal App Platform and how to make it super fast with minimal bugs. Previously, I helped build and scale our Analytics Infrastructure, where I was happily devoted to [Scala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7YQDnweQIc), [Akka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbTyy7vWQXo), and Kafka. 

Outside of work, I like to geek out making ArchLinux look pretty and I'm building a Slackbot in Elixir to share with the world soon.
