# Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

In a previous life I helped build early-ish versions of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7YQDnweQIc">Credit Karma</a> and managed a few engineering teams, including data/ML, web, and native platforms. 

Currently, I work as a hands-on consultant focused on data engineering and analytics. You can hire me to either consult on strategy + train your team or be hands-on to ship

* your next data-focused product
* data pipelines that streamline your analytics
* a data lake with data quality monitoring
* robust front end web/native tracking

After leaving Credit Karma, I've worked with companies like Haven (YC 19) and the University of Kentucky.
