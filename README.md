# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

I'm currently a Senior Engineering Manager at [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) leading the Client Infrastructure team. This means my day to day is spent thinking about the features of our internal App Platform and how to make it super fast with minimal bugs. Previously, I helped build and scale our Analytics Infrastructure, where I was happily devoted to [Scala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7YQDnweQIc), [Akka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbTyy7vWQXo), and Kafka. 

Outside of work I'm into making Linux look nice (see my dotfiles) and learning Elixir.
