# Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 
Are you or your team considering a new data initiative, but the team lacks experience in data engineering? Let me help! I have over 10 years experience in data-specific software engineering roles, with 5 years of leadership experience driving analytics engineering strategy at a tech ðŸ¦„.

In a previous life I helped build early-ish versions of <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/blog/how-credit-karma-makes-real-time-decisions-for-60-million-users-akka-streams-kafka">Credit Karma</a> and managed teams across data/ML, web, and native platforms. Projects I'm most proud of:
* Building a novel ad impression system
* Bootstrapping the technology to power broad data quality requirements
* Kafka and services migration to cloud infrastructure, data pipelines that scaled to 1PB++
* Our in-house A/B experimentation system "Darwin"

Today, I'm hands on and can build across your stack- infrastructure as code, data pipelines, API services, or front end with React/Vue. Past clients include <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/haven">Haven YC 20</a>, <a href="https://scholarrx.com/">ScholarRx</a>, and the University of Kentucky.
