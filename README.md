# Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dustin. 

In a previous life I helped build early-ish versions of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7YQDnweQIc">Credit Karma</a> and managed a few engineering teams, including data/ML, web, and native platforms. 

Currently, I work as a hands-on consultant focused on data engineering and analytics. You can hire me to either consult on strategy + train your team or be hands-on to ship

* your next data-focused product
* model training and inference pipelines
* a data lake with data quality monitoring
* robust front end web/native tracking
* infrastructure automation

After leaving Credit Karma, I've worked with startups and big organizations alike. Some of my current and past clients include Haven (YC 19), the University of Kentucky, and medicial ed-tech company ScholarRx.
